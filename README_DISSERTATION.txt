READ ME:

The main code for this project is the following file:
 - MERCHANT_TAGGING_FINAL.ipynb

All the other files on the "Extra_Experiments" folder are just exploratory experiments for the following situations:
- NER from Spacy implemented on Unknown Merchants Dataset
- LinearSVC implemented on Mixed Dataset (with Known and Unknown Merchants)
- LinearSVC implemented on Mixed Dataset without Pre-Processing
- LinearSVC implemented on Mixed Dataset without "%%%%%" (percentage separator)

- The resulting Excel files from the experiments are also included in the "Extra_Experiments" folder
- The resulting Excel files are 200 rows samples used for evaluation purposes and to compare with ChatGPT results


Important Note:
- The "Extra_Experiments" folder simply contains further experimentation
- The codes in the "Extra_Experiments" folder are all versions of the main code (MERCHANT_TAGGING_FINAL.ipynb)
- The codes in the "Extra_Experiments" folder have many the unnecessary lines comented
- In the codes in the "Extra_Experiments" folder do not have intuitive/descriptive variables which means that variable names not always correspond to the actual "action"
- The codes are all functional and useful for their purposes
